# Privacy Policy — Where It’s At
**Effective date:** 2025-10-31  
**Contact:** support@platovalabs.com

## Overview
Where It’s At helps you track loaned items and personal stashes. This app is designed to work **offline** with **local device storage**. We do not collect, transmit, or sell your personal data.

## Data We Store
- **Items, Loans, Stashes:** Names, due dates, places, optional notes.
- **Photos:** If you attach photos, they are stored locally on your device.
- **Settings:** Theme, reminder time, lock settings.

All data is stored **on your device** (e.g., local database/files). You control export/backup features.

## Permissions
- **Camera / Photos:** Optional, only to attach item or return photos. Never uploaded by us.
- **Notifications:** Optional, for due-date reminders.
- **Local Storage:** To save your data and exports you initiate.

## Data Sharing
We do not share personal data with third parties. The app has no analytics SDKs, ad SDKs, or tracking SDKs.

## Security
Data remains on your device. You can enable App Lock (Face/Touch/PIN) in Settings. Please secure your device and any exports you create.

## Retention & Deletion
You may delete any entry or **Delete All Data** in Settings at any time. Uninstalling the app removes locally stored app data.

## Children’s Privacy
The app is a general-audience utility. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your Rights
Because we do not host or process your data on our servers, requests like access/erasure must be performed locally by you using in-app tools (edit, delete, export).

## Changes
We may update this policy. We’ll change the “Effective date” above when we do.
