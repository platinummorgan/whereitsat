# who_has_it

**who_has_it** is an offline-first Flutter app for Android that helps you track items you lend to others (with due dates and contacts) and where you stash your own items (with photos of their locations). No backend requiredâ€”your data is stored locally and securely. Features include notifications, biometric/PIN lock, sharing, CSV/PDF export, and more.

## 7-Day Build Plan

**Day 1 (Oct 29):** Scaffold project, set up dependencies, Android config, and local DB structure.
**Day 2:** Design main UI flows (lend, stash, item details, navigation).
**Day 3:** Implement Hive models, item CRUD, and offline storage logic.
**Day 4:** Add photo capture/location features, image picker, and permissions.
**Day 5:** Integrate notifications, due date reminders, and biometric/PIN lock.
**Day 6:** Add export (CSV/PDF), sharing, and in-app purchase hooks.
**Day 7:** Polish UI, test, bugfix, and prepare for release.
