# Where its at

**Where its at** is an offline-first Flutter app for Android that helps you track items you lend to others (with due dates and contacts) and where you stash your own items (with photos of their locations). No backend requiredâ€”your data is stored locally and securely. Features include notifications, biometric/PIN lock, sharing, CSV/PDF export, and more.

## Android Release & Play Console Checklist

### Keystore & Signing

1. Generate a keystore:
	 ```sh
	 keytool -genkey -v -keystore release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias whereitsat
	 ```
2. Place `release-key.jks` in `android/app/`.
3. Edit `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
	 ```kotlin
	 signingConfigs {
		 release {
			 storeFile = file("release-key.jks")
			 storePassword = "your-password"
			 keyAlias = "whereitsat"
			 keyPassword = "your-password"
		 }
	 }
	 buildTypes {
		 release {
			 signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
		 }
	 }
	 ```
4. Build release APK/AAB:
	 ```sh
	 flutter build appbundle --release
	 flutter build apk --release
	 ```
